# loan approval prediction
LOANS are the major requirement of the modern world. By this only, Banks get a major part of the total profit. It is beneficial for students to manage their education and living expenses, and for people to buy any kind of luxury like houses, cars, etc. But when it comes to deciding whether the applicant’s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not. Banks have to look after many aspects.	We are going to develop one such model that can predict whether a person will get his/her loan approved or not by using some of the background information of the applicant like the applicant’s gender, marital status, income, etc.

#STEPS
- Data Cleaning : Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step is crucial for the model's accuracy and generalization. We may need to impute missing values, standardize or normalize features, and deal with any data anomalies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different variables, identify patterns, and gain insights. Visualization tools can be helpful in this phase.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model's performance. This might involve transforming variables, creating interaction terms, or encoding categorical variables.
- Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
- Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for your problem. Common algorithms for loan approval prediction include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
- Model Training: Train the selected model using the training dataset. This involves feeding the algorithm the features and corresponding labels and letting it learn the patterns in the data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
